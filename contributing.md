import.js and export.js have the code in readable form 
import.bookmarklet.js and export.bookmarklet.js contains exact bookmarklet code
So currently we have the same code repeated in three places
import.js import.bookmarklet.js and readme link.
In near future we can use automation tools like CI/CD or some scripting to automatically update .bookmarklet.js and readme
